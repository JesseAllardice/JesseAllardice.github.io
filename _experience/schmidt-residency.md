Participated in the first cohort of the Schmidt Data for Science Residency Programme at the University of Cambridge, through the Department of Computer Science and Technology, funded by the Schmidt Futures Foundation. This intensive 5-week course hosted by Cambridge Spark brings the participant up to speed with the latest in data processing, analysis and machine learning.

The programme - led by Professor Neil Lawrence, DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning - is designed to equip researchers in science disciplines outside computer science with the skills they need to use machine learning in their research.
