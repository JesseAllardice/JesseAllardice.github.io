Selected for Apple's inaugural AI Residency Program, where I was embedded in the Siri Natural Language Understanding team. This highly competitive program marked Apple's first formal AI residency initiative.

**Program Highlights:**
- First cohort participant in Apple's AI Residency Program
- Embedded with Siri NLU team in Cambridge, UK
- Focused on advancing natural language understanding capabilities

**Research Focus:**
- Trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for synthetic data generation
- Developed fine-tuning methodologies for natural language generation
- Advanced data augmentation techniques for improving model performance
- Production-scale machine learning system development and deployment

**Key Achievements:**
- Gained extensive experience developing and deploying ML software in production environments
- Contributed to Siri's natural language understanding capabilities
- Established foundation for subsequent senior researcher role

**Skills Developed:**
- Production machine learning system design
- Large-scale model training and deployment
- Cross-functional collaboration in industrial research settings
- Transition from academic to applied research methodologies

This experience provided invaluable insights into industrial-scale AI research and set the foundation for my continued work in multimodal foundation models.
