**Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Physics**

My dissertation developed next-generation technologies in solar photovoltaics for sustainable renewable energy. This work is at the forefront of solar spectral management research, pursuing optimal harvesting of the Sun's electromagnetic spectrum.

I employed ultrafast laser spectroscopy techniques to probe photo-physics and computational models to aid in the development of advanced nanomaterial structures. This research has enabled significant progress towards higher efficiency photovoltaic energy harvesting in both the academic and commercial fields.
