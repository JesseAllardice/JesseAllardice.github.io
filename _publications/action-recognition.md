excerpt: "Deep learning techniques for real-time exercise action inference purely from a webcam, developed as part of a computer vision startup."
---

Founded a start-up that leveraged deep learning techniques to infer exercise-actions purely from a webcam. This project demonstrated the practical application of computer vision techniques for fitness and health applications.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time action recognition from webcam input
- Deep learning-based exercise classification
- Lightweight implementation for consumer hardware

**Technical Approach:**
- Computer vision techniques for human pose estimation
- Deep learning models for action classification
- Real-time processing optimization

**Business Impact:**
This work was part of a startup focused on making fitness more accessible through AI-powered exercise recognition and feedback systems.
