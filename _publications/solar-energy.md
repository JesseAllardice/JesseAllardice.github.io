excerpt: "Quantum phenomena applications for efficient solar-energy generation, resulting in multi-million dollar company valuation."
---

During my PhD at Cambridge, I developed patents for next-generation electronics which I helped put into production with a commercial partner, resulting in a multi-million dollar company valuation.

**Commercial Impact:**
- Multi-million dollar company valuation
- Successfully transitioned from research to production
- Partnership with Cambridge Photonic Technology

**Technical Focus:**
- Quantum phenomena for solar energy applications
- Next-generation electronic device development
- Efficient solar energy generation systems

This work demonstrates the successful translation of fundamental physics research into commercial applications with significant market impact.
