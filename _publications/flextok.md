A novel approach to image tokenization that enables flexible-length sequences for improved multimodal learning. This work addresses long-standing constraints in multimodal learning by introducing flexible-length image token sequences.

**Key Contributions:**
- Flexible-length image tokenization methodology
- Improved multimodal learning performance
- Novel resampling techniques for visual data
