Excited to present "FlexTok: Resampling Images into 1D Token Sequences of Flexible Length" at **ICML 2025**!

**Event Details:**
- **Date:** Tuesday, July 15 at 4:30pm
- **Location:** Poster Session 2 East (E-Poster 3010)
- **Conference:** International Conference on Machine Learning 2025

**Research Highlights:**
This work introduces a groundbreaking approach to image tokenization that enables flexible-length sequences, addressing long-standing constraints in multimodal learning. The research represents a significant step forward in how AI systems process and understand visual information.

Looking forward to discussing this work with the ICML community and exploring potential collaborations!
