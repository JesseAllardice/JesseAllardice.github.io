Just wrapped up my time in the **Schmidt Data for Science Residency Programme** - what a truly amazing experience!

Big thanks to the **University of Cambridge** and **Schmidt Futures Foundation** for organizing this incredible opportunity, and to **Cambridge Spark** for delivering an outstanding virtual learning program. This intensive program equipped me with cutting-edge machine learning skills essential for transitioning from physics research to applied data science.
