Excited to present my project as part of Faculty AI's 18th Data Science Fellowship Demo Day!

I'll be showcasing the **groundbreaking AI work we've been doing in the fintech sector** with Upside Saving, demonstrating how natural language processing and transformer models can unlock new insights from financial data. This presentation represents the culmination of an intensive fellowship program focused on applying cutting-edge AI techniques to real-world business challenges.
