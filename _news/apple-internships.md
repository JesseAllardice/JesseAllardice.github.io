We’re looking for interns to push the boundaries of multimodal AI agents!

You will work on advancing the post-training capabilities of multimodal foundation models for agentic applications. This includes researching and developing methods to improve how these models understand, reason about, and interact with complex environments through techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. A primary goal of this internship is to produce novel research suitable for publication at a top-tier conference.
