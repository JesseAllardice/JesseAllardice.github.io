Thrilled to share our latest work on **BETR (Benchmark-Targeted Ranking)** - a novel method for matching pretraining data to benchmarks in language models.

**Key Results:**
- Achieved **1.8–2.8× compute multipliers** over strong baselines
- Demonstrated significant efficiency improvements in compute utilization
- Breakthrough in language model training efficiency

**Impact:**
The BETR methodology demonstrates how strategic data selection can dramatically improve language model performance while reducing computational requirements. This research has important implications for making large language models more accessible and environmentally sustainable.

This work represents a significant advancement in making AI more efficient and sustainable for the broader research community.
