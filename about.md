## About Me

I'm an AI researcher at Apple specializing in multimodal foundation models, image and video generation, and large language model pretraining. My work focuses on pushing the boundaries of how AI systems learn from and generate visual content, drawing on rigorous scientific methodologies and mathematical skills developed through my physics background.

## Research Focus

My current research centers on advancing multimodal AI systems at Apple, where I work on fundamental questions in multimodal foundation models. I'm particularly interested in pretraining foundation models on visual modalities such as video and using empirical models to inform pretraining design decisions.

Previously, as part of Apple's inaugural [AI residency program](https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/aiml-residency-program-application), I was embedded with the Siri natural language understanding team, where I developed and deployed fine-tuned language models for natural language generation and synthetic data generation in production environments.

## Scientific Approach

My research methodology is deeply influenced by my training in mathematical physics. I bring the same analytical rigor I used to model quantum phenomena to understanding AI systems: building first-principles theoretical frameworks, designing controlled experiments, and deriving insights from mathematical analysis. This physics-trained intuition for complex systems, probabilistic reasoning, and emergent behavior has proven invaluable in tackling fundamental questions in machine learning.

During my PhD at Cambridge, I developed analytical models for quantum systems that led to patented next-generation electronics, which I helped commercialize with [Cambridge Photon Technology](https://www.cambridgephoton.com/), resulting in a multi-million dollar company valuation. This experience taught me how to bridge theoretical research with practical impact, an approach I now apply to AI research.

## Technical Experience

My AI research spans **multimodal foundation models, computer vision, NLP, and robotics/autonomy systems**. I've applied these across domains: implementing NLP for fintech at [Upside Saving](https://www.upsidesaving.com/), developing computer vision for [exercise recognition](https://github.com/JesseAllardice/Action-Recognition), and working on autonomous systems.

My PhD work at Cambridge on quantum phenomena in solar energy systems led to patents and commercialization with [ambridge Photon Technology](https://www.cambridgephoton.com/), creating multi-million dollar value. I participated in the [Schmidt Data Science Residency](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/schmidt-data-science-course-scores-hit) and trained analysts at FTSE 100 companies with [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/).

## Research Philosophy

Impactful AI research requires understanding systems at a fundamental level. My physics training provides intuition for complex systems and emergent behavior, enabling me to design experiments and mathematical frameworks that capture essential AI dynamics. I aim to contribute foundational insights that advance theoretical understanding while creating technology that benefits society.
